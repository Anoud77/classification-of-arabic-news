# Arabic News Classification Project

This project focuses on classifying Arabic news articles into different categories.

## Objective

The core goal is to automatically sort Arabic news articles into predefined categories. This is useful for organizing news, enabling users to find specific types of stories, and analyzing trends within different news topics.

## Data

The project uses a dataset of Arabic news articles.

## Categories

The news articles are classified into several categories.

## How It Works

The system uses machine learning to learn the characteristics of each category from example articles. It then uses this knowledge to assign new articles to the most appropriate category.

## Relevance

This project is relevant to Arabic-speaking regions and anyone interested in processing or analyzing Arabic news content. It has applications in journalism, media analysis, information retrieval, and more.

## Models Used

The project utilizes and compares two different approaches:

* **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)**: A type of neural network that excels at understanding sequences of words, making it suitable for text.
* **Naive Bayes**: A simpler, but often effective, algorithm for text classification.
